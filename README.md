Pocket Pokemaster - Breakable Toy

----------------------------------
Description:
----------------------------------

A Breakable Toy is a capstone project for Launch Academy. The intention of this project
was to build a web application that uses a Ruby on Rails backend, with a React JS front end.

The web application created allows users to create an account and save Pokemon to that account.
Once saved, they will appear on an index page for quick access to their show pages, containing
stats, types and abilities unique to that Pokemon, from the PokeApi V2. Users are also able to comment
and start disscussions with other users on a Pokemon's page by entering their thoughts into a 
discussion form.

This project is a reflection of my technical ability at the time of graduating from Launch Academy. Becuase of this, I will not be seeking contributions at this time. The code is made publically available for employers, and any other Pokemon fans who would enjoy building a similar app and would benifit from seeing how I was able to get my code to function.
